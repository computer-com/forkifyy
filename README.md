ForkiFy - Restaurant Management System
Welcome to ForkiFy, a user-friendly restaurant management system we created to make life easier for restaurant owners, managers, and customers. Owners can add restaurants and check detailed reports. Managers can handle reservations, inventory, and menus—adding, editing, or removing items for their assigned locations. Customers can explore restaurants, visit their pages, book tables, and order food with a cart and checkout feature. We built this using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

Project Overview
ForkiFy is a team project designed to show off a full-stack app with different roles for users. We made it live online using Railway for hosting and MongoDB Atlas for the database, so anyone can use it from anywhere.

Running It Locally
Here’s how we got ForkiFy working on our own computers during development.

What You Need
Node.js: Get it from the official website.
MongoDB: Install it locally or use MongoDB Atlas from their site.
Setup Steps
Get the Code: We downloaded the ForkiFy files from GitHub.
Set Up the Backend: Went to the backend folder, installed the needed packages, and started the server with MongoDB running locally. If using Atlas, we updated the connection details in a config file.
Set Up the Frontend: Opened a new window, went to the frontend folder, installed its packages, and started the React app.
Check It Out: Opened a browser and went to http://localhost:3000 to see it running.
How We Deployed It
This is the process we followed to put ForkiFy online.

Setting Up the Database
Signed up for MongoDB Atlas and made a free cluster.
Added a user with a password for the database.
Copied the connection string, adding our database name (like "forkify").
Deploying the Backend
Uploaded the backend code to a GitHub repository.
Connected it to Railway by starting a new project and linking the repository.
Added the MongoDB connection string as an environment variable in Railway, then deployed it. We got a URL like https://forkify-backend.up.railway.app.
Deploying the Frontend
Uploaded the frontend code to another GitHub repository.
Added it as a new service in our Railway project.
Set it up to build the React app and linked it to the backend URL using an environment variable.
Deployed it and got a URL like https://forkify-frontend.up.railway.app.
Connecting Everything
Updated the backend to allow requests from the frontend URL by setting an environment variable, then redeployed it.
Tested the live app to make sure it worked.
